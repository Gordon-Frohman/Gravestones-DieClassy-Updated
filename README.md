# So why is this thing exists?
To my mind Gravestones - DieClassy is the best gravestone mod ever created (at least for minecraft 1.7.10).
But unfortunately minecraft 1.7.10 is long gone and no one really maintains mods for it. And even more unforunately there are some issues with the Gravestones mod.
For example it conflicts with the other mods that add a way to keep your inventory after death - Twilight Forest, Thaumic Horizons, you name it.
Or for whatever reason armor put onto a player bust gravestone renders perpendicularly to it.

And, because no one else would fix it, I did it by myself. And there you have it - Gravestones Die Classy v4

# Featuring:
 - Almost any other inventory keeping (but not gravestone spawning) mod support
 - Correct armor render
 - Brand new skin system, that would download player skins from the external server to render properly and even offline
 - Russian translation (because I'm also a translator)
 
 # Legal issues
 I've got a permission from Subaraki (or should I say AbsolemJackdaw?) himself to update his mod as long as I keep it open source. So yeah, no problem here
